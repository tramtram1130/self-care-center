# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
I built a self-care webpage using HTML and CSS. I used Javascript to add interactiveness and functionality to the webpage. The app generates a random message of affirmation or mantra for the user and allows the user to save their favorite messages.

### Installation Instructions:
- Fork the code from: https://github.com/tramtram1130/self-care-center.
- Initialize Git and clone it to your local machine.
- Run the app by typing in 'open index.html' in the terminal.

### Context:
I am currently midway through mod 1. I completed iteration 0, 1, and CYOA by Friday evening. I added an additional feature to further challenge myself.

### Learning Goals:
I wanted to better understand the relationship between the DOM and data model. I made sure to code functions that will manipulate the data model and code separate functions that will display the updated data model.

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges I encountered includes incorporating a delete button to remove messages from the favorites list. I was deciding between being able to double click anywhere on the specific message before clicking the delete button, but decided a radio button by each message is more visually pleasing and user friendly.
