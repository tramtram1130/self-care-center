# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
I built a self-care webpage using HTML and CSS. I used Javascript to add interactiveness and functionality to the webpage. The app generates a random message of affirmation or mantra for the user and allows the user to save their favorite messages.

### Installation Instructions:
What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Fork the code from: https://github.com/tramtram1130/self-care-center. After forking it, initialize Git and clone it to your local machine. Run the app by typing in 'open index.html' in the terminal.

### Preview of App:

### Context:
I am currently midway through mod 1. I completed iteration 0, 1, and CYOA by Friday evening. I added an additional feature to further challenge myself.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
I wanted to better understand the relationship between the DOM and data model. I made sure to code functions that will manipulate the data model and code separate functions that will display the updated data model.

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges I encountered includes incorporating a delete button to remove messages from the favorites list. I was deciding between being able to double click anywhere on the specific message before clicking the delete button, but decided a radio button by each message is more visually pleasing and user friendly.
